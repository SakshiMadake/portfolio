            <h4>Creative UI/UX Designer!</h4>
            <h5>Graphic Design | Product Management | Web Development | Chemical Engineer </h5>
            <p>Myself Sakshi Madake, currently pursuing B.tech in Chemical Engineering at IIT (BHU) Varanasi.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about UI/UX design, Product management, and Web Development. I have always been interested in design and worked as a design executive. I also learned about web development as I was interested in coding. In addition, I have also developed a keen interest in Product management. The intersection of technology and business presents exciting opportunities for innovation. So I started to focus on UI/UX designing.</p>
            <p>I'm searching for a part-time internship where I can use my UI/UX Designing skills and abilities. I want to work for a company to gain my professional progress and allow me to devote myself to my work.</p>
